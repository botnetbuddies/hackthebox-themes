Welcome to your Parrot Linux desktop!

Internet access is enabled for paid users subject to the following:
1. This instance is not meant to perform real assessments or interact with any live targets.
2. Pentesting any target (with or without consent) outside of HTB labs is prohibited.

Free users are limited to our own targets, and GitHub.

Remember! Do not store any personal or sensitive information in this box!
Its only purpose is to allow you to play in our labs.

Feel free to install any tools you prefer. 
You have a small amount of persistent storage in ~/my_data.
You can also add persistent customizations via ~/my_data/user_init file, which gets executed on startup!

While ~/my_data will persist, we cannot guarantee its availability, nor do we back it up! 
We cannot recover this data if it is lost! Do not store anything critical or sensitive here.

Note that once this instance is terminated, all data not in ~/my_data, including tools you installed, will be lost! 

PS: You have sudo :)
